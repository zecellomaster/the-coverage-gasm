# Welcome to The Projection Room!

After much delay, the forecast is finally ready! Before we dive in, however, is important to note a couple of things:

1) This forecast is based a lot on polling data, and while better quality polls are considered more than worse ones, it is still subject to pollster error and is only a snapshot in time.

2) It is important to note the fact that as with most numerical predictions, this only tells the *likelihood* of an event and therefore not a guarentee of what is **going** to happen.

3) The model assumes an election where all the votes cast are counted and the election overall is run fairly. Recent [events](https://ballotpedia.org/Changes_to_election_dates,_procedures,_and_administration_in_response_to_the_coronavirus_(COVID-19)_pandemic,_2020), [comments](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/9/30/21454325/trump-2020-peaceful-transition-election-stealing), and [actions](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/five-ways-trump-and-gop-officials-are-undermining-the-election-process/) have cast some doubt on whether or not that will happen this year  or at least to the extent it did in past elections, so expect uncertainty to be a bit more than expected.

## Presidential Election Forecast
### Forecasted Electoral Votes

Remember, 270 votes are required to win. A 269-269 tie results in a much more [complicated process to choose the presidency](https://www.270towin.com/content/electoral-college-ties/).

### Electoral College Map

The percent values represent the chance of victory for the incumbent, Donald J. Trump. Red indicates the *likelihood* of a Trump win while blue indicates a *likelihood* of a Biden win. The darker the shade, the higher the chance, with white being a 50%-50% tossup

### A Closer Look

Highlighted bold states are battleground races. Note that the margin of victory is negative if Biden leads and positive if Trump leads. Note that Nebraska and Maine use a [slightly different system](https://www.270towin.com/content/split-electoral-votes-maine-and-nebraska/) to allocate electors than winner-take-all, so the statewide vote for both is denoted with a (S) while the congressional districts are labeled individually.
